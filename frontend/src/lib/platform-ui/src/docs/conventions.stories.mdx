# Conventions

## Types

Types should be added for every component in the following way:

```javascript
import { JSXProps } from '../types'

declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      'my-component': JSXProps<MyComponent, { 'my-property'?: 'red' | 'blue' }>
    }
  }

  interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
    'my-component': MyComponent
  }
}

@customElement('my-component')
export class MyComponent extends LitElement {
  static properties = {
    myProperty: { attribute: 'my-property', reflect: true, type: String }
  }

  // ...
}
```

This ensures that types are set when using APIs such as `document.createElement('my-component')` or `<my-component my-property="red"></mycomponent>` in JSX. The JSX type definitions are also used by the React wrappers.

### Decorator Support

The Lit docs suggest using the `@property()` decorator for defining props. Currently, support for decorators is patchy due to several diverging standards. Because of our Babel configuration set via nx/storybook, we can not polyfill the decorators authored by Lit and therefor it is likely you will to run into problems when using them. Some example issues we've seen with the `@property` decorator include: no reflection of properties and re-renders not being triggered.

For now we advise against using decorators. This issue is on the Lit roadmap, and more details can be found [here](https://github.com/lit/lit-element/issues/205)

## Naming

Components should always be named with the prefix `sp-` ("Skedulo Platform"). If a component is intented only to be used in Storybook it should have the prefix `sp-sb-`. This allows us to clearly see what a component is doing, and what it's intended use-case is.

##Â Events

Event names should always be kebab-cased, and should be prefixes with `sp-`. Try to be as descriptive as possible with events, so as to avoid conflicts with other events.

## Property casing

Web component properties should use the following convention:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends LitElement {
  static properties = {
    myProperty: { attribute: 'my-property', reflect: true, type: String }
  }
  myProperty: string

  // ...
}
```

i.e.

- On the class the property should use `camelCase`
- The attribute should use `kebab-case`
- `reflect: true` should be used to ensure that properties that are changed directly are updated in the attributes - for example if an attribute is used for styling `[my-property="blue"] { color: blue; }`

This convention creates consistency across the components and is assumed by the React wrappers and in templates where HTML is parsed and all attributes become lower case.
